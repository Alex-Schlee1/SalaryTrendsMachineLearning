### Project Goal: Get insights about the job market for Machine Learning Engineers in England
* Scraped job information from Indeed.com using Python and Selenium
* Saved results in a csv file and manipulated and worked with the data using the pandas package



### Code and Resources
* Python Version: 3.7
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
* Packages: selenium, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy




## Part 1- Scraping Data with Selenium
* Job Title
* Company name
* Location
* Salary
* Job description

## Part 2- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
After scraping the data and storing it in csv and pandas, I had to do some cleaning steps like:
* remove rows where salary information is not availabe(before cleaning: 794 job entries, after cleaning: 211 job entries; data loss of more than 70(!))
* Changed the currency from 'Â£' to '$'
* Extracted salary range entries (min, max) and created a new column with the average value
* Changed salary entries to numeric data
* Created different columns for chosen skills and checked if they were mentioned in the job description column ('1'=Skill required, '0'= Skill not required

  * Python Skills       
  * R Skills 
  * Java Skills
  * AWS Skills
  * Hadoop Skills
  * SQL Skills 
  * Spark Skills
  * R Skills 
  * Matlab Skills
  * Tensorflow Skills 
  * NLP Skills

## Part 4- Project Limitation and Conclusion
Since more than 70% of the data was removed due to missing salary information and we just have 211 rows with job information, I decided not to build a machine learning algorithm to predict the salary (target variable). According to my opinion the dataset is just to small. I consider for future projects to build for example a multiple linear regression model when more data is available. In order to achieve that, other job platforms like for example glassdoor.com can be observed where probably more salary information is available and can be scraped.
